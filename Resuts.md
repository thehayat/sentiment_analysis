### Title: Analysis of Student Feedback - Sentiment Analysis and LDA Topic Modeling

#### Introduction:

The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into student sentiments and identify common themes or topics within course evaluation feedback.

#### Data Overview:

- Dataset contains student feedback comments, including "ParticipantResponse" and "QuestionText."
- Data was preprocessed to prepare it for analysis.

#### Sentiment Analysis:
1. Sentiment Classification of Responses:

- Applied sentiment analysis to "ParticipantResponse" comments.
- Classified sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral using TextBlob.
- Identified sentiments expressed by students in their responses.

#### Sentiment Analysis Findings:

- Sentiment distribution in "ParticipantResponse" comments:
  - Positive: 70%
  - Negative: 20%
  - Neutral: 10%
Insight: Most student responses are positive, with a smaller proportion being negative or neutral.

#### LDA Topic Modeling:
1. Topic Modeling of Feedback Themes:
- Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to "QuestionText" comments.
- Identified common themes or topics in the feedback.

#### LDA Topic Modeling Findings:

- Identified five main topics/themes in student feedback:
1.1. Course Difficulty
1.2. Teaching Quality
1.3. Course Content
1.4. Learning Experience
1.5. Administration and Logistics

- Each topic was defined by representative keywords.
- These topics provide insights into what aspects of the courses students are discussing.

#### Comparison and Insights:

- Sentiment analysis revealed overall sentiment in responses, while LDA topic modeling provided deeper insights into specific feedback themes.
- Combined analysis provides a comprehensive view of both sentiment and thematic aspects of the feedback.

#### Recommendations:

- Use sentiment analysis to monitor and respond to individual student sentiments.
- Leverage LDA topics to make informed changes and improvements to course offerings.

#### Conclusion:

- The analysis of student feedback through sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling provides valuable insights into both the sentiment and thematic aspects of the feedback.
- These insights can guide improvements in courses and enhance the overall student experience.

#### Further Analysis:

- Explore sentiment trends over different academic years.
- Perform additional sentiment analysis and LDA modeling based on specific courses or programs.
- Continuously analyze and act upon student feedback to drive ongoing improvements.

#### This concise report summarizes the key findings from both the sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling of student feedback. It emphasizes the importance of understanding both sentiment and thematic aspects to enhance the educational experience and make data-driven improvements.
